### CodeJudge (Hackocracy)

## Project Description

What could be better than having one’s own in-house coding judge that could store, compile, check for errors, and execute the code on some hidden test cases? With the increase in the utilization of coding tests for recruitment by software companies, it is necessary for an organization to have its own coding platform which they can easily use for practice purposes or to organize coding competitions. In this tough time of the pandemic, many students are losing their flow of coding, so we made a coding website where students can start coding to improve their skills. It can be difficult for beginners to just start doing coding without any prior knowledge. This problem can be tackled by providing articles and resources related to the question which can also help in deepening the concepts of the user.

Instead of relying on third-party coding websites like Codechef, Hackerrank anyone can use our project that is an open-source module that can be deployed on any machine for conducting coding competition or for practice purposes as well. This module can be easily deployed on any local machine without any problematic hassle.

Each coding problem also contains a list of related articles that can be read for understanding the problem or for improving one’s code. At places when the user feels he need to see the tutorial, then he/she can do so without any problem. A simple and clean user interface provides a better user experience. The user dashboard keeps the record of the problems solved by the user as well as the unsolved problems. The user can view the saved solution whenever required. There is also admin access, which allows the administrator to add, update, or delete coding problems.
 
## Software Design Description

User Interface

The website is divided into two parts: The admin part and the User part.

The admin part allows the administrator to add new problems, edit old problems, and to delete problems. Other than that, it allows the option to change name and password.

The user part allows the user to solve problems and to store their solution. It also allows them to change their name and password.

An option for login and register has been given to create accounts.

After registering, the user can log in to his/her profile and can immediately start solving problems available without any distractions. After logging in, the user is directed to the dashboard, which shows the total number of problems solved. The layout of the website is divided into three parts, the navigation bar, the sidebar, and the main screen. The navigation bar consists of the logo, user name, and profile image. On clicking the profile image, the user can get to settings or can log out. The sidebar consists of three links, one to the dashboard itself, one to the settings page, and the last one to the coding problems. The settings page has the option to change the name and password.

The problem page shows all the problems not yet solved by the user. Each problem can be solved either in C, C++, or Python.

Apart from that, the website is fully responsive and can be used on any device, be it on a mobile!

## Requirements / System Overview

The main purpose of this application is to make a coding platform that is freely available to everyone.
This can be used by an organization to test its members or by anyone who wants to improve his/her coding skills.

## Milestone

Further working on the project we will like to include a large number of problems and also tutorials for each problem so that the user can complete any problem without facing any difficulty. Also, a leaderboard can be added, so that users can see where he/she stands. A time can also be added that can freeze the screen and stop taking answers after a set time. A discussion form can also be added, where users can discuss and help each other.

The main prioritization of our project is the simplicity to use.

## Literature Survey

Computer programming is not easy to learn. It is even more difficult to teach and study it in developing countries where there a few qualified professionals and there is no motivation for learning. Everyone learns at their own speed, for some learning is done by discussing with others while some find it better to explore and read on their own. When students get demotivated by not being able to solve a problem they resolve to copy others and plagiarism.  In order to tackle this situation, it is crucial to develop a study environment that helps students in their active participation and assess their strengths and weaknesses, and motivates them to learn. An increase in practical lab hours with the effective impartation of knowledge by focusing on problem-based learning can help in implementing such an environment.

## How this solution different from the past:

We have made this project keeping in mind different things that have been done. There are many coding sites but the simplicity and ease of use of this web application for personal use or its use in coding competitions make it better than others. In case of any difficulty, it will also give a particular tutorial for that problem.

## Aim of the project:

We have made this project keeping in mind two themes, which are Atma Nirbhar Bharat and the Post-Covid world. With this web application, the users can easily do things in one place only i.e. coding as well as tutorials also.

## Scalability:

This module can run on any Linux machine. Some modifications need to be done for it to work on a windows machine. The use of PDO prevents any SQL injections.

## Features

Easy to use
Open Source
Platform Independent
Leaderboard Access.
Tutorial + Practice in one place.
